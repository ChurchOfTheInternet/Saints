# Saints
These are people we think have contributed significantly to the evolution of mankind thru their online content.

Three primary criteria for canonization are as follows:

1) Large impact - The contributions made by the candidate should have reached a very wide audience, exemplifying the power of the internet to connect beings all over the planet. <br>
2) Profundity - The contributions should resonate deeply with people, somehow expressing genuine, deep feeling, communicating from the heart. Most music videos, comedies, blogs will fail in this category.
3) Pro-human - In keeping with Priciple 2 of the Church of the Internet, the contributions should reflect a love of humanity, life, the earth, nature, the universe. Makers of profoundly moving videos expressing hatred for life would not be eligible for canonization regardless of their popularity.
4) ?

This is a work in progress, so if you think somebody should be on this list, please tell us.

- Yosemitebear62 a.k.a. Double Rainbow Dude
We choose yosemitebear62 to be canonized because of his famous "Double Rainbow" video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI
This video received tens of millions of views, and captures yosemitebear62 reveling in ecstasy at the sight of a double rainbow. His profound appreciation of the beauty of nature, his heroic spirit of adventure and the tremendous number of people he has touched make him an exemplar of what the COTI stands for.
